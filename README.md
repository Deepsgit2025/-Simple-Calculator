💡 How It Works

Button clicks are captured using addEventListener
Values are appended to the input field
Special operations like % and ^2 are converted into valid JavaScript expressions
eval() is used to calculate the final result

⚠️ Note

This project uses eval() for simplicity.
In real-world applications, using eval() is not recommended due to security risks.
